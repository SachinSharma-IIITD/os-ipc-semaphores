OS : A3 : Q1 PART-A : Strict Ordering
*************************************

This is a program to simulate the philosophers dining problem using Strict ordering of resource requests.
The program makes strict ordering of philisophers based on their indexes, so that no 2 philisophers access same resource at the same time, and consition of deadlock cannot take place.

Steps to run;
    1. Just run the Makefile (make sure Makefile is present in the folder just outside src and bin)

Thank You!
